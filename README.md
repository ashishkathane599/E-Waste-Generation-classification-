# E-Waste Generation Classification 📱💻🔌

This project focuses on building a classification model to predict e-waste generation categories based on relevant features. It addresses the growing environmental concerns around electronic waste by using data-driven insights to inform recycling and disposal strategies.

## 🚀 Project Overview

Electronic waste (e-waste) poses serious environmental hazards. Proper classification of e-waste generation patterns can aid policymakers, recycling agencies, and sustainability efforts. This project leverages machine learning techniques to analyze and classify patterns in e-waste data.

## 📚 Dataset

The dataset contains various features representing socioeconomic indicators, electronics usage, population metrics, and regional attributes. It was sourced from [provide source or say "custom-collected dataset"].

### Features include:
- Country/Region
- Number of electronic devices per capita
- Population density
- Urbanization rate
- GDP per capita
- Recycling rate
- Previous year e-waste generation

### Target Variable:
- Category of e-waste generation (Low, Medium, High)

## 🧠 ML Approach

The classification pipeline includes:

- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
  - Handling missing values
  - Feature engineering
  - Scaling and encoding
- Model Training using:
  Transfer learning
  
- Model Evaluation:
  - Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1 Score
  - Confusion Matrix
  - Feature Importance Analysis

## 📊 Results

The XGBoost model provided the best performance with:
- Accuracy: 0.9802 %
- Precision: XX%
- Recall: XX%
- F1 Score: XX%

Graphs and visualizations of performance metrics and feature contributions are included in the notebook.
